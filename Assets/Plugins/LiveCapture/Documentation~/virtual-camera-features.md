# Unity Virtual Camera features

## Preview, recording, and playback

* Live preview via **video streaming** between the Unity Editor and the mobile app.

* **Editor viewport** to see the virtual camera's view from the editor workstation.

* Video streaming support for Unity's built-in, URP and HDRP render pipelines.

* **Record camera performances** to animation clips and play back the results.

* Works in both Edit mode and Play mode in the Unity Editor.

## Physical camera controls

* Bi-directional control of camera settings from either the Unity Editor or the mobile app.

* Control **focal length**, **focus distance** and **aperture** with configurable damping for a smoother feel.

* **Reticle Autofocus (AF)** mode to automatically set the focus distance based on a screen reticle.

* **Tracking Autofocus (AF)** mode to have focus distance dynamically match a scene object's distance to the camera.

## Camera motion tracking

* Camera tracking via Apple's ARKit.

* Additional camera motion controls via **virtual joysticks**.

* Temporarily halt tracking and reposition around the physical space.

* **Motion scaling** to multiply physical motion.

## Dolly simulation and ergonomics

* **Axis locking** to prevent motion in any combination of 6 degrees of movement.

* Camera **motion damping**.

* Steadicam simulation using Cinemachine.

## Workflows

* Non-destructive and iterative workflow â€“ change camera settings such as damping and focal length after a capture session.

* **Snapshots** system to save an image along with your camera's position and metadata like lens information that can be loaded to pick up where you left off.
