# About Live Capture

Use the Live Capture package to connect to the Unity Virtual Camera and Unity Face Capture companion apps to capture and record camera motion and face performances.

## Available client apps

Two apps compatible with the Live Capture package are currently available (for iOS):

* The [Unity Virtual Camera app](virtual-camera.md) allows you to capture and record camera motion through an iPhone or iPad as if you were physically in the Unity Scene.
* The [Unity Face Capture app](face-capture.md) allows you to capture and record face movements through an iPhone or iPad and apply them on a character in your Unity Scene.

## Live Capture package features

* Manage the [connections](ref-window-connections.md) between your data sources and the Unity Editor.
* Use the [take system](take-system.md) to record, manage, and play back Live Capture takes.
* Use [timecode synchronization](timecode-synchronization.md) to temporally synchronize all your data sources and manage their synchronization status in the Unity Editor

* [Install the Live Capture package](#install-app) in your Unity Editor and meet specific system requirements.
